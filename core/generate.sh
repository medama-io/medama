# The browser Beacon API sends all content in text/plain even if the content is in JSON.
# As ogen-go validates the Content-Type header from our OpenAPI specification, this is a
# workaround to patch api/oas_request_decoders_gen.go to add text/plain to the list of
# accepted content types for the /event/hit endpoint and still use the same JSON decoder.

# This runs sed and replaces a line number with a new line.
# This should be verified after each update to the OpenAPI specification or ogen-go
# in case the line number changes.
#
# sed also runs differently on macOS and Linux, so we need to check the OS before running it.
