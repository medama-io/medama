## Development

### Prerequisites

Install the following tools for the project:

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) - API server (core)
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) - Required for CGO in Go (core)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) - JavaScript runtime (dashboard, tracker)
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) - Global task runnner

We recommend using [mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/) as a convenient version manager tool for all the languages and tools required for this project.

### Setup

We use [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) to run scripts and tasks to simplify the development process. Please refer to each sub-project's Taskfile for understanding the available tasks.

A full development setup can be done by running the following commands in separate terminals:


```bash [Terminal 1]
cd ./core
task dev -- start # Start API server
```

```bash [Terminal 2]
cd ./dashboard
task dev # Start dashboard dev server with HMR
```

More details on the development setup can be found in the respective sub-project READMEs.
